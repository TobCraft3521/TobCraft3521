At the Hopkinton High School tennis courts, students gathered for a pickleball tournament hosted by the Hopkinton Organizing for Prevention (HOP) Youth Coalition. The event, part of the group’s effort to promote substance-free activities and mental wellness, brought together over 35 participants for friendly competition, food, and community spirit.

Members of the HOP Youth Coalition explained that they organize events to encourage a fun and inclusive environment, while also focusing on mental health and wellness. “We’re all part of this organization called HOP,” said sophomore Kashvi Gupta. The coalition aims to help students with substance abuse and mental health issues, and regularly plans talks at local schools about topics such as vaping and suicide prevention.

Participation ranged from regular tennis players to first-time pickleball competitors. “I play tennis for the tennis team and I really like pickleball,” said Henry, a student at the event. Another player, Tyr, commented, “We’re just here to have fun, you know? It’s amazing.”

To ensure a good turnout, members of the coalition said they advertised with flyers around the school, sent information to teachers, and posted announcements in student memos. Kaitlyn Wilson, a member involved in planning, said, “I think this is just a really great event for the community. The turnout is really great and having the ice cream truck here was a really good idea.”

Gift cards and ice cream vouchers added excitement to the tournament. Nathan Bruce, who won a raffle prize, said, “I want a gift card. I also got a free ice cream thing from my man, the police officer,” giving a clear sense of his enthusiasm and appreciation for the event.

As the games ended, Matthew, one of the participants and winner of the tournament, reflected, “It’s just fun to be with the community and play pickleball. Life is like a mountain—you don’t get to the peak without the struggle of the journey.”

Through substance-free events like this, the HOP Youth Coalition continues to promote wellness, connection, and positive choices for Hopkinton’s youth.
